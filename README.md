# Data Preprocessing and Modeling Tool

## Purpose of Plan
Data is a valuable resource in most companies, especially in this era of internet of things; although, Data in the real world (raw data) is usually dirty. Hence, the need to subject the data to several steps and
processes, to improve the quality of the data before subjecting it to further analysis.
Data quality refers to the state of qualitative or quantitative pieces of information. There are many definitions of data quality, but data is generally considered high quality if it is "fit for [its] intended uses
in operations, decision making and planning. If data quality degrades, it leads to complete wrong insights of unpredictable results.
I propose an efficient data quality frontend tool integrating statistical and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, to improve the quality of your data within the shortest time possible. Our data quality tool allows you to integrate data from CSV files, and
                                            then profile and clean it with unparalleled ease using simple point-and-click actions on big data sets to increase the quality. It also provides complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
